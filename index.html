                Hello! I am Radhika.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am a PhD student in Stanford’s mechanical engineering department since Fall 2016. 
                My PhD research focuses on experimental characterization of mechanical properties of nanomaterials. It involves synthesizing nanoparticles, thin films and nanostructures to study their strengths, deformation mechanisms and other relevant mechanical properties. My PhD life has given me the opprtunity to explore one of the most fascinating worlds of nanoscale, things I could never imagine until I actually saw. Stanford has amazing shared facilities where I got a chance to operate instruments like Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), that I had only read and wondered of in books. And inspite of all the fancy instrumentation, its fascinating that nanoscale research is still based on a lot of observation, correlation, hypothesizing mechanisms, and coming up with innovative ways to verify them. 
                </p>

                I am an ardent patron of design thinking and innovation. My fascination about improving experience through small improvements, what Indians love to call 'Jugaad' was one of the reasons I chose mechanical engineering, believing products and innovation are an imperative part of the subject. Building up on my interest I have explored product design, innovation, entrepreneurship and product management in my undergrad and grad life. However I think that design thinking is not limited to just products and markets but could be used anywhere including research. I also think that good products in today’ s world can be designed only if we can leverage all possible exciting technologies at our disposal, especially in computers. To design better solutions, I must understand what can be possible, and for this reason, I have continued to get acquainted with the trending topics of machine learning, data mining, nlp, deep learning etc.

                I’m a strong believer of expanding horizons on all aspects of life. I love to acquire and improve on new skills and activities, it’s my definition of progress and source of adventure. Whether its academic like learning a new subject, or nonacademic, like picking a new language, all is fair game for me. For this reason I’m fond of a lot of extra-curricular activities, not expert in any, but a flavor of many. Being a very audio-visual person, I love to paint and play with colors and hum and sway to guitar and keyboard. Over time I have turned into a health freak paying close attention to running, swimming, gymming and healthy eating habits. And last but not the least, I love social dancing, something I am very proud I picked up at Stanford. Waltz, polka and swing are some of my favorites.
                </p>
                <p>
                With this I will conclude my introduction.
                Thank you for taking the time to read and know me. I would be more than happy to get in touch, converse, discuss and learn about anything .
