                To appreciate the world around us and resarch about its historic aspects, the World Civilizations class had a project activity to 
                explore the interiors and heritage details of the city - I was in IIT, and we were in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a>. The city is known to weigh heavy on its historic importance, and generally some of the most obvious relics of this aspect are 
                the old stone built gates that used to be part of protection and borders. (By the way, Ahmedabad has somewhere around 12-16 gates, and I come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangabad">Aurangabad</a> which has about 52 gates.  It is literally also called 'City of Gates'.. so you can imagine how routine they are for me. As a child I used to think Delhi Darwaja (gate) and Paithan gate were names of different colonies around 😝). 
                In a team of 6, we set out to explore our assigned one - Dariyapur Darwaja (gate). Gaurav, Mihir, Abhishek, Saurabh, Vamsi and Me. 
                This video is our exploration - researching, interviewing, photography, sketching, and fun, it includes all. I was a bit scared to climb the gate, so I stayed down - now I think I should have.. :D

                A videography workshop was organized to teach us the basics, we were a small group of people interested in designing. 
                First task - had to think about what we wanted to portray. A video with impact is a video with purpose.. wow.. I had not been much engaged with even knowing about <a href="http://initiatives.iitgn.ac.in/nyasa/">NYASA</a> till then beyond that it was 
                the social initiative run by students in my IIT. 
                In an attempt to show the world, I learnt a lot myself - and I am not just talking about the deep emotional impact it had to sit and hear the stories and aspirations, or 
                the realization and gratitude about the exsiting I developed..
                Believe it or not, this is where I learnt why my photos never looked that good earlier 😅.. the 3x3 grid rule, long shots, how to take interview shots, capturing emotions in close ups, joining the dots and framing the story, scripting and so much more that's just at the sub-conscious level now.. 
                NYASA's impact did not remain only to the concerned, after all, I guess, good intentions of some can help progress for a lot more than we think ..
